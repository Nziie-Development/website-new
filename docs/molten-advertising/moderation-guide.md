Make sure to <strong>read advertisements</strong> before you issue an advertisement warning (ad warn) and <strong>DO NOT</strong> issue false warnings! This can result in a strike or a removal from the Moderation Team
</div>

<details className="customdetails">
<summary>üîë Key</summary>

> `[foo|bar]` - Text separated in brackets means you can use either **foo** or **bar** to get the same command result

> `[arg=value]` - An argument in brackets means this is an **optional argument**, if it's not provided a default value of '**value**' will take it's place

> `<arg>` - An argument in less and greater than signs means that this is a **required argument**, it must be provided or the command will fail

### Commands

The commands we use for advertisement warnings are mainly slash commands. <strong>Make sure you're using the latest version of Discord</strong>!

When warning a member and they reach **2 ad warnings**, warn them with **Server Manager** bot the expiration being **7 days**:
<blockquote><span className="timestamp">/warn member:id custom_reason:2aw duration: 7d moderator_hidden:True</span></blockquote>

<details className="customdetails">
<summary>Command Explanation</summary>

The `/adwarn` command sends a message in the <span className="mention">#üö®Ô∏±open-moderation</span> channel and is stored in the database of **Molten's Utilities**. A **warning ID** is random generated ID which is _12 characters long_. This ID is unique to every advertisement warning, users can find this ID at the embed footer of the ad warning message *and* direct message they get. Users can message the modmail bot <span className="mention">@Molten Support#3319</span> to appeal this warning. These warnings are stored for **7 days** then removed (expired). Users are notified of this expiration.

<summary>Command Arguments</summary>

*These are the arguments that aren't self explanatory*

> `belongs_to_channel` - This argument is only required and used when you use the `Incorrect Channel` preset reason. This is the channel the advertisement would belong to.

> `notes` - This argument is displayed as an embed field on the ad warning embed. This is typically not used unless you need to provide more context. **Example below**.
