Hey, I'm Nziie (en-zee). IRL, I'm just a 16 year old male in high school. I played football for 9 years but now I am in sports media getting paid by my school to film football & lacrosse. I love coding and I have been making bots for 3 years. I started making bots because I could never find a public bot that fit my needs for customization, reliability, and robust features. Now, I make bots to fill those needs for others.

## Custom Discord Bots
In partnership with [AnonDev](https://anondev.ml), I offer cheap hosting for the custom bots on powerful servers with good uptime. **If you are interested in getting custom bot from me, please join [my Discord server](/discord.html) and open ticket**.
