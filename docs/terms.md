<br/>

<span className="rulenum">1.</span> To ensure compliance, both you and your server, including your bot, must adhere to [Discord's Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms), [Discord's Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines), and [Discord's Developer Policy](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/terms-of-service) consistently.

<span className="rulenum">2.</span> The approval of requested features/source code is at my discretion, and denial may occur without providing a specific reason.

<span className="rulenum">3.</span> Your bot must remain in the development server (<a href="support">Nziie Development</a>) for continuous online functionality. Leaving the server will result in your bot going offline until your return, with no refund provided.

<span className="rulenum">4.</span> Please refrain from rushing me; excessive impatience may lead to cancellation of services without a full refund. Patience, like that of other clients, is appreciated.

<span className="rulenum">5.</span> Product prices are subject to change during your tenure. Your payment may be adjusted to the new price or slightly lower. Priority Clients are exempt from product price changes, ensuring they pay the initially agreed-upon price. Price adjustments may reflect market demand or total resource costs. In the event of a price change, you can negotiate renewal prices by opening a ticket in the [development server](https://nziie.is-a.dev/discord).

## Refunds
<span className="rulenum">1.</span> Refund requests for your bot may be denied without specific reasons.

<span className="rulenum">2.</span> Refunds are not applicable under any circumstances, given the real-money nature of hosting costs, which are non-refundable.

## Source Code Guidelines
:::danger
Source code requests may be denied without specific reasons; modmail bot and music bot source codes will not be provided.
:::

‚≠ê <span className="rulenum">1.</span> It is imperative to retain credit in the code for certain commands/features in the provided source code. Removal of any credit will result in the termination of source code access and removal from the development server, along with the cancellation of any purchased services. The source code may be connected to an API, detecting credit removal, causing the bot not to start or specific features to malfunction.

<span className="rulenum">2.</span> Leaving the server at any time will trigger the consequences outlined in rule 1.
