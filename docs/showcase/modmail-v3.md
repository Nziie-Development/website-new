## Integrated Menus System
The thread menu system allows users who are creating a thread to choose from preset options set by admins. Depending on which option they select, the thread will move itself to a category set by *you*, in the option settings.

### Adding options

### How it looks

<img className="betterimage" src="https://cdn.nziie.is-a.dev/u/files/7thrGbvIIjhs"/>

---
You can have as many options as you'd like, as long as it doesn't exceed the Discord select menu option limit.

## Thread Logging

v3 showcases enhanced thread logging. You can manage the *global thread logs* with the <span className="cb">!logs</span> command and sub-commands.

### Discord-Styled Logs
Yup! No gloomy Pastebin logs anymore, v3 uses [logs.discord.website](https://logs.discord.website) that uses Discord styles. The entire thread history is uploaded to the website for ease of use and makes it easier to view later (your data is 100% safe).

## Permission Levels
v3 uses permission levels to decide which user can use what command.


## Conclusion
Improvements are being made to v3, so if you have a v1 or v2 modmail bot, you will need to [pay $2 USD](https://redirect.nziie.is-a.dev/donate) for your bot to be migrated to v3. This includes me manually transferring any snippets you have, or other configurations you want saved in v3; which is a pain.
