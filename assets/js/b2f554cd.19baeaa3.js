They are\'t a company you should be *investing* in as they have broken Discord\'s and YouTube\'s ToS. Discord won\'t do anything about them breaking their own ToS as they want the money, Top.gg won\'t do anything because MEE6 is paying roughly **$100,000** a year on ads, so it looks like Top.gg is doing it for the money. [MEE6 Alternatives](#mee6-alternatives). \\n\\n## MEE6 DM Advertisements\\nAt approximately <span className=\\"timestamp\\">11/24/2022 2:59 PM (PST)</span>, MEE6 direct messaged **tons** of members that MEE6 has access to (which uses it\'s [Members](#mee6image) intent) an advertisement that links them to their [Top.gg](https://top.gg) page to vote for them (DM advertising). Discord doesn\'t allow this on behalf of a bot as it abuses their API and is against their Terms of Service, including the Discord Developer Policy. Discord has not done anything about this while they were getting thousands of support tickets from users who were DM advertised by MEE6. Sound\'s like **corruption** at Discord and makes it look like both *\\"companies\\"* are *best buds*. I\'m not trying to throw Discord under the bus here, but it\'s been proven.\\n\\n<img className=\\"betterimage\\" src=\\"https://cdn.nziie.is-a.dev/u/files/8VpJdk1LdZQw\\" id=\\"mee6image\\"/>\\n<p className=\\"caption\\">Intents</p>\\n\\n<img className=\\"betterimage\\" src=\\"https://cdn.nziie.is-a.dev/u/files/yr6vNEnpgjWb\\"/>\\n<p className=\\"caption\\">Proof of DM advertisement</p>\\n\\n## MEE6 Music\\nI\'m sure we all remember the terrible news that [Groovy](https://groovy.bot/) and [Rhythm](https://rythm.fm/) were being shutdown due to YouTube\'s forceful command. This was because they were using YouTube\'s API for music, **while** having a premium version of their bot/service; which is against YouTube\'s Developer/API Usage Policy. Since they are earning money from a free API/service, YouTube and stealing ad revenue from those artists that made the song(s) while making money. Now, you can *legally* have music bot that uses YouTube\'s API, but you **cannot** have a premium version of the bot. **MEE6\'s music plugin is a premium perk**, thus doing what Rhythm and Groovy did. Discord did ask Rhythym and Groovy to shutdown, and they did. **However**, Discord has not shown any intention to shutdown MEE6 to help prevent themselves or MEE6 from getting sued by YouTube. \\n\\n## Top.gg Ads {#topgg-ads}\\nWith everything said, Top.gg doesn\'t allow servers/bots on their site if it break\'s Discord\'s ToS or their own ToS, but they don\'t care since MEE6 is paying **THOUSANDS** of dollars a month on top.gg ads (**roughly $100,000 a year**), so clearly, Top.gg is only doing it for the money, proven [here](https://youtu.be/cD9Rpq8d_wk?t=279). However, Top.gg claims they won\'t do anything until Discord does something. So hopefully YouTube will take action which will *force* Discord to do something, which will *finaaalllly...* cause Top.gg to do something; thus causing MEE6 to not grow as fast and decline in growth and marketing. \\n\\nNow, I personally use Top.gg Ads for [Sentry](https:/sentrydiscord.xyz) and have seen decent results. Top.gg is very useful as at one point, Server Manager was at the front page of the website for the most voted new bot in a short duration of time and it got me 500 servers in ~2 weeks without paying a cent, which was crazy. \\n\\n## MEE6 Staff Members\\nSince MEE6 staff members were volunteer at one point, they could say whatever they want since they weren\'t getting paid. But since all of this happening, they **fired all their support staff and moderators** and replaced them with **paid staff members**. Thus, basically paying them to keep their mouths shut about the situation and to handle the controversy, instead of complaining to the Developers, explained [here](https://gist.github.com/ZRunner/3c765fe054228c0a12add9f0006b1948#mee6-the-darkest-times). \\n\\n## MEE6 Alternatives\\nThere are many alternatives to MEE6, here is a list of some good ones - taken from <a href=\\"https://www.alternativestomee6.com/\\" className=\\"discord-link\\">www.alternativestomee6.com</a>.\\n\\n-  <strong><a href=\\"https://sentrydiscord.xyz\\" className=\\"discord-link\\" style={{\'color\': \'#5865f2\'}}>Sentry</a></strong>\\n-  <a href=\\"https://sapph.xyz/\\" className=\\"discord-link\\">Sapphire</a>\\n-  <a href=\\"https://yagpdb.xyz/\\" className=\\"discord-link\\">YAGPDB</a>\\n-  <a href=\\"https://pancake.gg/\\" className=\\"discord-link\\">Pancake</a>\\n-  <a href=\\"https://atlas.bot/\\" className=\\"discord-link\\">Atlas</a>\\n-  <a href=\\"https://dyno.gg/\\" className=\\"discord-link\\">Dyno</a>\\n-  <a href=\\"https://pepemanager.com/\\" className=\\"discord-link\\">Pepe Manager</a>\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion \\nPlease **remove MEE6** from your servers and **cancel** any premium subscriptions you have tied to MEE6 or it\'s services. They are\'t a company you should be *investing* in as they have broken Discord\'s and YouTube\'s ToS.\\n\\nI\'ll be posting updates about this situation in the [MEE6 Controversy](tags/mee-6-controversy) tag, stay tuned!"},{"id":"python-classes","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/python-classes","source":"@site/blog/2022-10-16-python-classes.md","title":"Python Classes & Usages","description":"What are Python classes and how do you use them?","date":"2022-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 16, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Guides","permalink":"/blog/tags/guides"}],"readingTime":2.05,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Nziie","title":"who?","url":"https://nziie.xyz","imageURL":"https://github.com/Nzii3.png","key":"nziie"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"python-classes","title":"Python Classes & Usages","description":"What are Python classes and how do you use them?","authors":"nziie","tags":["Guides"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"MEE6 Controversy & Explanation","permalink":"/blog/mee6-controversy"}},"content":"![](./assets/car_example.png)\\n\\n## What are Python classes?\\nTo put it simply, Python classes are like an object constructor or a \\"*blueprint*\\" for creating objects. You can also create a class to organize commands or event listeners and load them later using [Pycord](https://pycord.dev) or [discord.js](https://discord.js.org).\\n\\n## Breakdown\\nLets break down a simple class of a **Car**.\\n\\n\\nSo here is our code that we\'re working with...\\n```py title=\\"car.py\\"\\nclass Car:\\n  # highlight-start\\n  def __init__(self, year, made, model): # When you use \'Car()\' you will pass\\n    # in these values that are set in the class\\n    self.year = year\\n    self.made = made\\n    self.model = model\\n  # highlight-end\\n\\n  def start(self):\\n    print(\'Vrrroooooooooommmm!!!\')\\n  \\n  def turn_off(self):\\n    print(\'*Powering down...*\')\\n\\n  def year_made(self):\\n    return self.year\\n\\n  def month_made(self):\\n    return self.made\\n\\n  def show_model(self):\\n    return self.model\\n\\n# highlight-start\\nmy_car = Car(2000, \'December\', \'Lexus\') # Create the car from the class\\n# Setting the year to 2000, the month to \'December\' and\\n# and the model to \'Lexus\'\\n# highlight-end\\nmy_car.start() # >>> \'Vrrroooooooooommmm!!!\'\\nmy_car.year_made() # >>> 2022\\nmy_car.show_model() # >>> \'Lexus\'\\nmy_car.month_made() # >>> \'December\'\\nmy_car.turn_off() # >>> \'*Powering down...*\'\\n```\\n\\nThe class <span className=\\"timestamp\\">Car</span> has some functions being <span className=\\"timestamp\\">start</span>, <span className=\\"timestamp\\">turn_off</span>, <span className=\\"timestamp\\">year_made</span>, <span className=\\"timestamp\\">month_made</span>, and <span className=\\"timestamp\\">show_model</span>. All of these functions return or print a value from the class, the values being the attributes of the class (<span className=\\"timestamp\\">year</span>, <span className=\\"timestamp\\">made</span>, and <span className=\\"timestamp\\">model</span>). You can access these attributes by doing `car.year`, etc.\\n\\nIf you\'re using **Pycord** or **discord.py** it would look something like this...\\n\\n```py title=\\"mycog.py\\"\\nimport discord\\nfrom discord.ext import commands\\n\\nclass MyCog(commands.Cog):\\n  def __init__(self, bot):\\n    self.bot = bot # you can access your bot object here\\n  \\n  ### stuff ###\\n\\ndef setup(bot):\\n  bot.add_cog(MyCog(bot))\\n```\\n\\nThen in your main.py or bot.py file...\\n```py title=\\"main.py\\"\\n# ...\\n\\n# if you have your cog file in a \'cogs\' folder:\\nbot.load_extension(\'cogs.mycog\')\\n# if you don\'t:\\nbot.load_extension(\'mycog\')\\n```\\n\\n## Functions Setting Attributes\\nYou can even make functions to set attributes within the class.\\n\\n```py title=\\"car.py\\"\\nclass Car:\\n  def __init__(self, year, made, model):\\n    self.year = year\\n    self.made = made\\n    self.model = model\\n\\n  def start(self):\\n    print(\'Vrrroooooooooommmm!!!\')\\n  \\n  def turn_off(self):\\n    print(\'*Powering down...*\')\\n\\n  def year_made(self):\\n    return self.year\\n\\n  def month_made(self):\\n    return self.made\\n\\n  def show_model(self):\\n    return self.model\\n\\n  # highlight-start\\n  def set_year(self, year):\\n    self.year = year\\n    print(f\'Set year to: {year}\')\\n  # highlight-end\\n\\nmy_car = Car(2000, \'December\', \'Lexus\')\\n# highlight-start\\nmy_car.year_made() # >>> 2000\\nmy_car.set_year(2005) # >>> \'Set year to: 2005\'\\nmy_car.year_made() # >>> 2005\\n# highlight-end\\n```\\n\\n:::danger\\nMake sure you have correct syntax in or you will get an error!\\n:::"}]}')}}]);
