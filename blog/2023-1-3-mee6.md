**Topic:** Discord's corruption with [MEE6](https://mee6.xyz) breaking [Discord](https://discord.com/terms)'s and [YouTube](https://youtube.com/terms)'s Terms of Service.

I'd like to start this off by saying that anything in this blog post is proven and factual in the video below.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cD9Rpq8d_wk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### TLDR
Please **remove MEE6** from your servers and **cancel** any premium subscriptions you have tied to MEE6 or it's services. They are't a company you should be *investing* in as they have broken Discord's and YouTube's ToS. Discord won't do anything about them breaking their own ToS as they want the money, Top.gg won't do anything because MEE6 is paying roughly **$100,000** a year on ads, so it looks like Top.gg is doing it for the money.

## MEE6 DM Advertisements
At approximately <span className="timestamp">11/24/2022 2:59 PM (PST)</span>, MEE6 direct messaged **tons** of members that MEE6 has access to (which uses it's [Members](#mee6image) intent) an advertisement that links them to their [Top.gg](https://top.gg) page to vote for them (DM advertising). Discord doesn't allow this on behalf of a bot as it abuses their API and is against their Terms of Service, including the Discord Developer Policy. Discord has not done anything about this while they were getting thousands of support tickets from users who were DM advertised by MEE6. Sound's like **corruption** at Discord and makes it look like both *"companies"* are *best buds*. I'm not trying to throw Discord under the bus here, but it's been proven.

## MEE6 Music
I'm sure we all remember the terrible news that [Groovy](https://groovy.bot/) and [Rhythm](https://rythm.fm/) were being shutdown due to YouTube's forceful command. This was because they were using YouTube's API for music, **while** having a premium version of their bot/service; which is against YouTube's Developer/API Usage Policy. Since they are earning money from a free API/service, YouTube and stealing ad revenue from those artists that made the song(s) while making money. Now, you can *legally* have music bot that uses YouTube's API, but you **cannot** have a premium version of the bot. **MEE6's music plugin is a premium perk**, thus doing what Rhythm and Groovy did. Discord did ask Rhythym and Groovy to shutdown, and they did. **However**, Discord has not shown any intention to shutdown MEE6 to help prevent themselves or MEE6 from getting sued by YouTube. 

## Top.gg Ads {#topgg-ads}
With everything said, Top.gg doesn't allow servers/bots on their site if it break's Discord's ToS or their own ToS, but they don't care since MEE6 is paying **THOUSANDS** of dollars a month on top.gg ads (**roughly $100,000 a year**), so clearly, Top.gg is only doing it for the money, proven [here](https://youtu.be/cD9Rpq8d_wk?t=279). However, Top.gg claims they won't do anything until Discord does something. So hopefully YouTube will take action which will *force* Discord to do something, which will *finaaalllly...* cause Top.gg to do something; thus causing MEE6 to not grow as fast and decline in growth and marketing. 

Now, I personally use Top.gg Ads for [Sentry](https:/sentrydiscord.xyz) and have seen decent results. Top.gg is very useful as at one point, Server Manager was at the front page of the website for the most voted new bot in a short duration of time and it got me 500 servers in ~2 weeks without paying a cent, which was crazy. 

## MEE6 Staff Members
Since MEE6 staff members were volunteer at one point, they could say whatever they want since they weren't getting paid. But since all of this happening, they **fired all their support staff and moderators** and replaced them with **paid staff members**. Thus, basically paying them to keep their mouths shut about the situation and to handle the controversy, instead of complaining to the Developers, explained [here](https://gist.github.com/ZRunner/3c765fe054228c0a12add9f0006b1948#mee6-the-darkest-times).
